# Typing Meteorite - README
To make life easier, the compilation work is automated using **ant build**. The ant build script file is generated from Intellij. In order to make run, please follow the steps below.

# Prerequisites
1. **Ant** binary file from Apache. *You can grab a copy from [ant.apache.org](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)*
1. **JDK 1.8+** for the support of *Lambda Expression*
1. Files submitted:
  * `meteorite.properties`: specify JDK path
  * `meteorite.xml`: ant build script
  * `src` directory: all source files
  * `db` directory: data files in txt
1. (*Optional*) A markdown viewer to view this README file in full experience.
  * Online Viewer: [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)
  * Offline Viewer: Atom with its builtin markdown viewer
  
# To Build
> If you already have ant in path, you can directly run `ant` from command line. Otherwise, you need to specify that in command prompt with full path.

1. (*Optional*) Specify the path to Java1.8 JDK in meteorite.properties. Script usually runs even with path unspecified.
  * Default: `jdk.home.1.8=C\:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_20`
1. Run `ant "artifact.meteorite:jar" -f meteorite.xml`
  * `artifact.meteorite:jar`: Task name, to output `.jar` file
  * `-f`: Argument to specify next parameter being the script file
  * `meteorite.xml`: Ant script file
  * Whole process takes several seconds. You will see `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` if it succeeds.
    * `out` directory: All compiled source files;
    * `__artifacts_temp` directory: `.jar` files
1. Put the `db` directory into where `.jar` file is located.

## Final File Structure
```
./__artifacts_temp
  |- ./db
    |- word.txt
    |- boss.txt
    |- player.txt
  |- ./meteorite_jar
    |- meteorite.jar
  |- meteorite.jar
./out
./src
meteorite.xml
meteorite.properties
```
# To Run
Execute the `meteorite.jar` file.

## Java Security Settings
For Java 8+, you need to add the directory into the exception list, or local `.jar` won't run.
  * (e.g.) `file:///D:/test/__artifacts_temp/`
    * Not backslash `\` but slash `/`
    * Begin file `file:///`
    * Should be a **directory path**, not a file

## Stacktrace with Main Class Not Found
Make sure the following lines are included in the `meteorite.xml`, within the `<target name="artifact.meteorite:jar">` tag,
```xml
<jar>
  <manifest>
    <attribute name="Main-Class" value="meteorite.Main"/>
  </manifest>
</jar>
```

## Honor Board not saved
This is caused by having missed the `db` directory in where the .jar file being located. Please follow the **step 3** in **To Build** section.
